Libraries used - matplotlib for plotting, csv for reading csv file, numpy for using vectors and matrices
All the req graphs are also in this zip for ease of access
execute all parts with python(i used 3.7.4).

NOTE: a file "theta.csv" is created for storing the theta values for quick access by the other programs, 1a_b will give a permission denied error if this csv is opened before the execution of 1a_b.

NOTE: regression is performed in all sub parts except 1a, with 5,00,000 iterations,approx 40 seconds(on my machine) are required for 1a_b's regression part

NOTE: theta.csv needs to be created(by running 1a_b.py) before execution of 3rd or second parts

1a_b- 
1b- Simply execute to get the training graph and then all the estimated theta values and the error values printed on teerminal(takes approx 40-60 seconds)

2a_b - execute the file, the graph will appear one by one, required outputs printed on terminal (almost instantly)
NOTE: currently open graph needs to be closed before the execution of the code can execute further

3a_b - execute the file, the graph will appear one by one, required outputs printed on terminal(takes approx 30 seconds)
NOTE: currently open graph needs to be closed before the execution of the code can execute further
